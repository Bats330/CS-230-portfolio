When looking at the The Gaming Room client and their software requirements we were requested by Creative Technology Solutions to expand their game called Draw it or Lost it on to multiple platforms. We were to evalaute which operating platform
For how how the game application software could be deployed and ran and what the following requirements would be to do this. When taking a look at our documentation I feel a section that I did particular well on would have to be going over
the various operating platforms and evaluating the pros and cons in each of them in specefic requirements like server side, Client side and the development tools for each. I also feel that I did a pretty solid job on recomending specfic platforms and tools
to be used after going over each of these pros and cons. For me the structure of the design document proved to be the m,ost beneficial for me as I tend to add to much information to make sure everything gets covered but in turn I cover more than what was 
needed adding to a mess in my work so the structured document allows for a more straught foward work process making sure all the work requirements were met with out over complicating everything. If i could go back and revise part of my documentation I would go
back and work over the domain model to clean up the writing a bit more and make things a bit more concise and easier on the eyes when reading it as I feel now looking back on it it is a tad bit messy.

When looking at what the client needed and adding them into our software design I ensure the documentation went over all thier needs like security and storage systems that would best suite them in terms of what they were trying to achive
It is very important to consider the user needs when designing as that is the whole reason you are working on the project in the first place is for the users you are trying to ensure all of thier requirements are met and the work is what
the client is wanting. I approached designing software in a clear and steady manner working on it in steps to ensure that all of the requirements were getting met. I would say I need to develop some better time management and stragies
for my next big project as during this whole projecty I was behind trying to claw my way out which lead to some very stressfull work periods that couldve all been solved if I were to manage my time better. I would use the software document
in the future aswell since it allowed for a clear understanding of what we were looking to do when it comes to the software development process so hopefully i will retain that knowledge in design and continue to use this skill to my advantage and
allow for a more stremalined development process.
